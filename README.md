# Once-ler | Chop down ratters.

It has come to my attention that some people think ClickCrystals is a rat.
This is not true, a user under the alias of L0rqx has copied our GitHub and upload malicious code to it in attempt to steal people’s Minecraft accounts. 
The only trusted download links are the one on our modrinth, https://modrinth.com/mod/clickcrystals and the one on ItzISpyder’s GitHub, https://github.com/itzispyder/clickcrystals 

any other downloads should not be trusted, as they may contain malware. If you see any other viruses Disguised as Click Crystals, please report them on the official CC discord. https://discord.gg/R7n7V8Nyp5
